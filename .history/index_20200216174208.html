                                <h2>Myth #1: All sharks eat people</h2>
                                <p>Some researchers such as Daniel Bucher, a shark expert at Southern Cross University,
                                    suggest that human flesh is unpalatable to sharks and that people are far from being
                                    the predators' meal of choice.</p>

                                <h2>Myth #2: Sharks aren't clever and have tiny, walnut-size brains</h2>
                                <p>False. Sharks are actually one of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean,
                                    thanks to more than 400 million years of evolution. The animals' brain-to-body ratio
                                    is similar to that of most birds and mammals, according to a paper by Leo Demski and
                                    R. Glenn Northcutt who studied shark brain size in 1996.</p>

                                <h2>Myth #3: All sharks are big and scary, and have lots of sharp teeth</h2>
                                <p>There are more than 450 species of sharks, and they come in all shapes and sizes. The
                                    basking shark is the second largest fish in the sea, but it eats only plankton with
                                    its tremendously large mouth, which can measure more than 3 feet (0.9 m) wide.</p>

                                <h2>Myth #4: If you're attacked by a shark, you should punch it in the nose</h2>
                                <p>That's probably not a good idea. The best way to escape is to go for the shark's eye.
                                    Sharks have an eyelid-like barrier to protect them from prey thrashing around in
                                    their jaws, but it's not designed to shield from fingers.</p>

                                <h2>Myth #5: Nothing eats sharks</h2>
                                <p>While the largest sharks, such as tiger sharks and whale sharks, have very little to
                                    worry about from predators, the smaller sharks are not so lucky. Some shark species
                                    are incredibly small, and so they can make handy snacks for larger species. A few
                                    marine mammals, including orca whales, prey on sharks, too.</p>
